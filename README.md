# Type Before It's Gone

A fun and challenging web app built with Flask, JavaScript, and CSS — where you must type continuously to keep your words from disappearing! Stop typing for too long and everything is erased. Type long enough, and you win.

## Concept
- Once you begin typing, a countdown begins. If you stop for more than 5 seconds, your words are erased. But if you manage to type continuously for 5 minutes, your message is preserved, and the challenge ends.
